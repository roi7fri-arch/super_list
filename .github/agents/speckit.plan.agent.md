$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Include mandatory household synchronization requirement for shared-list features (near-real-time cross-device sync within household)
   - Include architecture decision for realtime sync transport (WebSocket or equivalent) with fallback polling strategy
   - Include data model coverage for Household, Membership, SharedListItem, ListEvent, DeviceActionQueue
   - Include API/contract coverage for subscribe/get household list, add/update/remove item, and replay endpoint (if used)
   - Include explicit server-authoritative conflict resolution policy (timestamp LWW + remove precedence)
   - Include offline/reconnect retry-backoff strategy
   - Include observability metrics for sync latency, delivery success rate, and replay failure alerts
   - Include household-scoped authorization model on all list operations
   - Include test strategy mapped to requirements with contract + integration + e2e + real-device two-family-device sync tests
   - For mobile scope, include real-device execution strategy (Android USB debugging and iOS physical-device run path where available)
   - For mobile scope, include required tools/prerequisites and local PC command flow for physical-device test execution
   - For mobile scope, require evidence artifacts: machine-readable test report, logs, and pass/fail summary for the critical voice-to-list flow
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
- For mobile features, ERROR if physical-device execution plan, command flow, and evidence artifacts are missing
- For shared-list features, ERROR if mandatory household synchronization architecture/contracts/tests are missing
